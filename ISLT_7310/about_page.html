        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I’m currently a sophomore at the University of Missouri, pursuing a degree in mathematics and an IT certificate. This combination reflects my dedication to blending analytical skills with technical expertise. The IT certificate, focusing on Python and C#, will complement my math studies and provide a competitive edge for my career goals.</p>
        
        <h2>Education and Background</h2>
        <p>My homeschooling background allowed me to manage dual credit classes at Missouri Southern State University while working part-time at Goodwill and Walmart. I aim to become an actuary, and I believe that the IT certificate will be valuable in this field by demonstrating my proficiency in programming, which is increasingly important in actuarial work. Integrating these technical skills with my mathematical training will enable me to solve complex problems effectively.
            In summary, my academic achievements and diverse experiences prepare me well for a successful career in actuarial science, where I can leverage both my mathematical and programming skills.
